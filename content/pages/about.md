I am plebian.

I prefer to keep my professional and internet porn life seperate, so any vagueities are just to anonymize things a little.

I've got a background in software development and writing. I have several years of experience in game development, and more in general programming. I've been a
part of a very skilled development and operations team that ran and developed a game played by thousands.

I'm one of those "weird sex perverts" that you sometimes hear about on the internet. I've got an interest in many strange niche fetishes, particularly in the general sphere of fat fetishism.
