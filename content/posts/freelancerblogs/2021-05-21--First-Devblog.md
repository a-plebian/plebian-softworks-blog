Working title for this series. Give me better ideas.

So this is a project that's been stewing in my brain for a long time and I think what exactly I want out of it is finally starting to crystalize after a lot of waffling, starting over, and side diversions.

Enter Freelancers.

So think of this as an announcement for a game I'm working on, and the start of a weekly post about my work on it. I'm going to be working on a simulation-management type game sort of in the vein of rimworld or dwarf fortress with a fetishy slant to it.

I'm a big fan of Factorio's Friday Facts devblog. I would highly recommend reading through it. It's pretty much the best game dev blog series ever written, they go into extensive detail on design, technical, and artistic processes. I can only hope to achieve that quality, and I'm starting this because I need *somewhere* to collect thoughts, report progress, and babble incoherently about whatever hairbrained shit I've come up with this week.

So let's get into it.

# What is it?

I'm making a sci fi management-life sim with RPG elements.

Enough buzzwords for you? I think I need to work on my elevator pitch.

It will be a real time management game focusing on caring for the needs of a live-in "business" (Colony? Harem?) venture in a cyberpunk future where a common agreement is "freelance" work. A freelancer" is someone who voluntarily engages in a contract where they both work for and are cared for by another legal entity in exchange for low cost housing, basic necessities, etc. Most freelancers are engaged in more favorable of contracts; they can leave whenever they want under any circumstances for a better one. Of course, the more desperate may have a conditional requirement, or a time restriction where they can't terminate it early without huge fines.
A big focus is going to be on the relationships and wellbeing of your Freelancers. You'll construct a facility that caters to theirs (or your) interests while providing adequate job opportunities. Of course, if you have ulterior motives, they can be manifested via various training, dietary, or medical regiments or less savory of job choices. After all, sex sells and there's a high demand for it.
On top of this, affluence in the city itself can be useful. Get involved in shady bio-modding rings to cater to a more exotic clientele, Perhaps you can swing regulations in your favor or even take power yourself. Maybe zero terms contracts aren't as out of reach as you think...

# Background

So why am I starting over again instead of helping someone else out or finishing one of my many piles of unfinished projects?

I'm not helping on many of the open source projects or modding projects because frankly, a lot of them are really horribly made and difficult to work with. There's more there to start with but to get anything close to what I want I would need to rewrite and refactor large sections of the codebase, do tons of optimization, and also change a lot of the core of what was there to begin with. It ends up not making sense to butt up against existing means so much, and prefer instead to lay my own track.

As to why I'm tossing aside my own unfinished projects, they ended up slowly mutating in vision over time to become this project. Every time I just kept mentally scope creeping over and over to wanting to make this.

Also they were really poorly made. Most of them I started a few years ago, and since then I've gotten the opportunity to work with some extremely good dev groups and learned a lot about software development in general. I think I know enough now to tackle such a complicated task a lot better, and can learn even more from this.

# Wrapping Up
Well, here we fucking go. I know this is vague but I don't really have anything at all worth showing yet, and that I do have I want to have material for at least a few weeks before I start struggling on these hard.

Next week is gonna be uuuuh...AI probably. Deep technical dive of sorts. See you then. Follow me on twitter or FA or whatever if you want to see more updates.
