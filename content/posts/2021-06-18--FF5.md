So this last week, a lot of the world has been experiencing a massive heat wave.

Here, it has been over 100F since last saturday.

I work a pretty physical job in a building without AC, so it's been very unpleasant. I've been so drained
following work I haven't really had the energy to do anything besides screw around.

I made this epic artsy moodboard to convey what it's been like:

# what I did this week

I spent a lot of time discovering that Bevy's game state system is very incomplete and debugging strange errors. That's pretty much it.

# uuhhh

In lieu of actual interesting Game Dev News(tm), I decided to just asspull a bunch more filler lore about the setting
that I've never properly written down.
