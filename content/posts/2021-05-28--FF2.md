What's up gamers, back at it again with another low substance development blog.

Going forward, this series will be called Freelance Fridays

This week, I had my soul removed by build tools, contemplated future design plans, and then threw everything away and started over for the first time.

# Gradle is Upsetting

So I spent most of the initial weekend attempting to write a plugin for artemis-odb that would better support modern Gradle.

Gradle is a build tool, dependency manager, scripting framework, genital torture device, and general bringer of misfortune that is very commonly used when working with Java and related programming languages. I actually don't hate it that much, it just is extremely cumbersome because it does *so* much. If you were in the discord you got the live experience of me ripping my hair out over trying to get a nicer build experience for artemis-odb, an ECS framework (put a pin in that, I'll explain more in a minute.)

I ended up spending around 20 hours total trying to get this working and never actually did. I also ended up not being super happy with the workflow experience of artemis-odb after resigning to use the older plugins. Welp.

# ECS

So what is an ECS framework? There's better technical write ups than here, but it stands for Entity Component System, and is a way of structuring games or any other data that aids in composition and can boost performance.

A more traditional way of building a game is more Object Oriented. When you need shared functionality, you make a common thing that has the functionality, and then "extend" it into separate specific implementations.

This is a pretty intuitive way of thinking about the world and development. "Dogs" are "Animals" that have four legs and bark, for example. You start running into problems as soon as you run into "generic" traits of things. For example, A lamp is something you can switch on or off, and is producing light or isn't, ie

![ez](/media/inheritance.png)

And then oh shit, oh god oh fuck why is Dog a 6th level subtype of AbstractMoving in an inheritance chain that includes names like "BitingAnimal" and also it implements ILeggable and ICarnivore oh shit what the fuck is going on.

![oh no](/media/ohshitohfuck.png)

Composition is an alternative approach where instead of creating hierarchies and graphs of meaning, you "compose" smaller pieces into the final product. Instead of "is a" relationships, you have "has a" relationships. A "Dog" is not an "Animal" with four legs, it's merely a thing that among other things has four legs.

ECS takes this a step further, and says that the actual "Entity" is nothing. An Entity is just a thing that "contains" Components and then is acted on by Systems. Components don't even "do" anything, they're just a bunch of data. I found this utterly useless broken SVG and it made me laugh, so I'm putting it here:

![broken](/media/what.png)

What this means in a more practical sense is massively increased flexibility. You don't have to worry as much about how things get new behaviors, you can just tack in all the components needed and the systems will start operating on them automagically. You can also much more easily reuse the same data with differing operations on them. It’s also really damn fast.

To link this all back with Freelancers, I can achieve an *extreme* amount of flexibility of the characters. I can way more easily have large and distinct variations in the functionality without having to worry about a huge mess of inheritance. It’s way easier for things to be modified in real time without any performance hits. This means far more “exotic” and difficult to manage characters in all kinds of different ways can exist in the game without all kinds of hackery. Extreme physiology or body parts, nonhuman species, or perhaps even completely nonhumanoid characters could be made and actually properly fit together.

Neat.

# Engine Swap

So after the never ending battle against the tide of Java Build Tooling, I finally got things working, and then ended up not being super happy with the frameworks and libraries I was using. I like Kotlin, but there’s not really anything built for game dev with Kotlin in mind. KTX is alright, but it’s just an extension of LibGDX and I’m not a huge fan of the general layout and functionality of LibGDX. Artemis-odb definitely has the performance of a capable ECS framework but it’s not very ergonomic with Kotlin and has a lot of fiddly bits, especially regarding how much reflection it uses. This brought up a question.

## Why not use an engine?

Originally I didn’t want to because I wanted to learn a bit more about the process of building an engine, and am psychotic and wanted more control. I quickly realized I actually understand a lot of this process pretty well. It's just annoying. Really annoying. Lots of things that you take for granted end up not being there and then you have to reimplement them yourself and it’s a huge waste of time. I spent most of the week just working on a system to support rebinding keys well. It’s a pain in the ass. So fuck it, I say, I’m still in prototyping phases, let’s start over. I didn’t really have much done.

## What engine?

Some I considered, but rejected were:
Unreal Engine 4: I have some experience with UE4, and it’s 2D tooling is very weak. Doesn’t have great support for composition.
Unity: Don’t like Unity’s workflow. DOTS is interesting, but I also am not a huge fan of relying on closed source as critical parts of my development environment.
Amethyst: Cripplingly poor compile times. Messy APIs
GameMaker Studio: Aimed at a completely different target audience

I ended up narrowing it down to two, Bevy and Godot. There’s upsides and downsides to both:

### Bevy

Bevy is a lightweight engine written in Rust that’s designed around a very high performance ECS system. As a result it’s got first class support for ECS and the entire engine is designed around it.

#### Pros

- Built around ECS from the ground up
- Extremely fast parallel ECS system
- Passionate community
- Built entirely with Rust, and I’ve been interested in Rust for a while
- Engine and Games are in the same language
- Really clean APIs

#### Cons

- Very immature, first release was around the middle of last year
- Missing some core planned functionality like a visual editor
- 2D Renderer has some performance issues, but is viable for basic usage. Planned to be worked on.
- Slowish but acceptable compile and iteration times.
- Only supports Vulkan on desktop

### Godot

Godot is an open source engine I've been seeing catching on recently. It came a bit more to my attention with the launch of hit sewer misery stock market simulator Cruelty Squad.

#### Pros

- Been around for a decent amount of time, has some serious projects made in it.
- Large community
- Has bindings for many languages including Kotlin
- Really good editor

#### Cons

- Built in composition support is weak, and no ECS support natively. An ECS extension exists but isn’t very widely used.
- Written mostly in C++ (DISCUSTING)
- Again weak 2d renderer, but performance improvements have never been properly merged even if they’ve been worked on.

## Decision Time

I’m going to start with Bevy and if it ends up sucking or Rust is too big brain for me I’ll go with Godot.

# Two steps forward, two steps back

This week was pretty much progress neutral with the exception of research. I started various writeups about overarching design plans but none of them were quite ready to be published yet.

Next week is AI.
